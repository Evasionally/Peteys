# Instructions
## Beginning the Game
* To begin the game, download the attached zip and unzip it. Once downloaded and unzipped, simply launch the .exe file. If your computer warns you about a potential virus, please ignore it. We can assure you that this isn't just an elaborate plan to steal your credit card details.

## Controls
* We plan on having a short tutorial level when the game ships, but for now we will just tell you the controls.
* Use the WASD keys to move forward, back, left and right, and the spacebar to jump!
* Move the mouse to rotate the camera.
* Press the "Q" key to do a Bash Attack! This attack has a short cooldown.
* Right-click the mouse to go into "Aim Mode." Inside aim mode, you can:
     * Left-click the mouse to shoot pepperoni. You have 10 at a time, which will reload when you run out.
     * Press and hold the "E" key to grapple & swing, but only onto floating Green Peppers. You'll know them when you see them.
          * It also may be worthwhile to try grappling anything green!
* Press the "Esc" key to pause the game.
